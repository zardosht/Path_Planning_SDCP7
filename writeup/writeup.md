#### Udacity Self-driving Car Nanodegree
# Project 7: Haighway Driving
#### Motion Planning


In this project a jerk minimizing trajectory must be planned for the the AV. The simulator provides localization and tracking (sensor-fustion) data and the our job is to generate a collision-free trajectory with minumum jerk. 

The project code is organized in different modules: 

* **Map:**
* ***Predicition:**
* ***Behavior Planning:**
* **Trajectory Generation:**
